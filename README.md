# PacMan Exercise  
This is an animation of PacMan, from the classic video game, moving from one side of browser window to the other. Once he reaches one side he flips and returns back the way he came. 
### Installation

### Roadmap  
I would like to make PacMan move around the entire perimeter of the browser window in the future.
